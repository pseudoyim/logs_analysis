# Project 1: Logs Analysis

## Program design

The general design of this program (`analyze.py`) is as follows:

- Import statements
- SQL queries for each question
- Functions to run each query and format the output in Python

NOTE: Requires Python 3


## How to run

After starting your Postgres server with the newsdata database, run:
```
python analyze.py
```
